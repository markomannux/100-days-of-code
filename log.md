# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Done some refreshing on #NodeJS and #express with @freeCodeCamp APIs and Microservices Certification. Got some insight in middleware writing

**Thoughts:** There's always something new to learn even in subjects you know from a long time. Express middleware was kinda black magic but I took the time to analyze it.

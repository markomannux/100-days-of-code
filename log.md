# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Done some refreshing on #NodeJS and #express with @freeCodeCamp APIs and Microservices Certification. Got some insight in middleware writing

**Thoughts:** There's always something new to learn even in subjects you know from a long time. Express middleware was kinda black magic but I took the time to analyze it.

### Day 2: August 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the @freeCodeCamp section about mongoDB and mongoose. Completed the first Microservice challenge.

**Thoughts:** I must rely more on tests. Callbacks can be greatly simplified. I'm using new tools which rely strongly on automation and I think I should take them as example.

### Day 3: August 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed header parser and url shortener challenges from @freeCodeCamp. Explored url and dns native modules in nodejs. Trying to stick to VS Code for the whole workflow

**Thoughts:** I think Ishould gain bettere confidence with my tools. Not become an expert but being proficient. Spend the right amount of time on that.

### Day 4: August 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Wrote about a problem I had with #gradle and #springboot  on #DEVCommunity  https://dev.to/markomannux/gradle-daemon-with-multi-module-spring-project-3nog
Started the exercise tracker challenge in 
@freeCodeCamp
Seems longer than previous ones, just had the time to prepare the field!

**Thoughts:** Writing down things is a long work but seems to repay in terms of clearance of mind. Plus, is quite satisfying. Trying to do it more.

### Day 5: August 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**:completed the APIs and Microservices challenges @freeCodeCamp and got my certification

### Day 6: August 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started Quality assurance course @freecodecamp. Written a post about regex capturing groups

**Thoughts:** Writing for others is really difficult but it's the best way to organize thoughts about an argument

### Day 7: August 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Still on Q&A course @freeCodeCamp Started integration with #passport Done some other interesting katas @codewars and having fun!

**Thoughts:** Katas are a great way to improve skill on a programming language and learn new tricks, but I find them not really useful for actually building something

### Day 8: August 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: no much progress today because, you know, weekend and a lot to do at home Still managed to put a little time on the challenge @freeCodeCamp

### Day 9: August 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I've made some progress on the challenge about securing an application @freecodecamp

**Thoughts:** Nothing really new here, but learned something about express API: http mehods handlers callbacks can be multiple and their execution can be chained by calling next().
